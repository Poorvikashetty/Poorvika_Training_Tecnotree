        <p>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was an Indian physicist who made groundbreaking contributions to the study of light and sound. Born on November 7, 1888, in Tiruchirapalli, India, Raman studied physics and mathematics at Presidency College in Chennai, and went on to earn a PhD from the University of London.</p>
        <p>Raman is best known for his discovery of the Raman effect, which is a phenomenon in which light scatters when it passes through a material, causing a change in its wavelength. This effect has been used in a wide range of fields, including chemistry, biology, and materials science.</p>
        <p>In recognition of his contributions to science, Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. He also served as the director of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, and was a member of the Royal Society and the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
